### IAF DATABASE

- Our paper titled "Identity-aware Fingerprint Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks" has been submitted to CVPR 2022. We will keep the database available ***only for the reviewers*** in supplemental materials until the end of the review process  (March 2022).

- Our method of generating synthetic fingerprints divided into two stages. The first stage is capable of creating new fingerprint identities from five fingerprint classes separately, and the second stage models factors such as sample area, orientation, deformation, and texturing.
